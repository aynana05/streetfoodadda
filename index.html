    <h3>Bite of Memories</h3><br>
    Street food has always been my passion. From tangy chaats to spicy rolls, every bite is an adventure.I started this website to share the joy of street food and the flavors that make every street corner special.<br><br>
    I’ve always loved exploring street food, tasting all the flavors and spices.
    Every snack tells a story — the tangy chaats, the spicy rolls, the crispy samosas — each bite is full of joy and memories.<br><br>
    I started this journey to share my love for street food with everyone.
    Come, taste what I enjoy the most!
